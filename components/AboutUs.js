                <h2 className={styles.headingSub}>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    We believe that every piece of art has a story, and our mission is to uncover that story through collaborative analysis. From the <strong>symbolism</strong> in a painting to the <strong>narrative technique</strong> of a film, we seek to connect art lovers with the deeper meaning behind every piece.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    By doing so, we hope to build a community that appreciates the <strong>transformative power of art</strong> and its role in shaping society.
