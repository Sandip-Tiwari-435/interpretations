Dont speak-
Its about lead singers in a band who face the real audience and are the face of the group. In the first scene of the music video, we see a rotten orange which probably means the particular person of the band is inherently and genetically a bad person, is hungry to do something bad. He sees the ways that things are going in the band. He spreads the inferiority caused to other band members because of mere presence of this audience-loved lead singer. Before the rotten person came into the band, things were good. Members had love for each other, they engaged and really enjoyed. The rotten person spreads hate in the minds that the lead singer is getting all the fame and they are not. They look down upon the singer. Theres a scene where the singer is getting prepared for a show, and the members sigh for how long she is taking to get ready. This shows the members are now not concerned about their appearance and charm, but instead annoyed at the singer. "Dont tell me coz it hurts" is a clear statement, that the band members want her to leave. "I know what you are thinking" means the singer has read the body language of the members and is not ready to ignore it anymore. She never intended to get the fame but nothing can be done about, she is just too passionate. In the end the rotten

Personal Jesus:
People who make their own rules, moral values and have control of their lives. You are your own god. No need for any validation from any one else in the world. Someone who hears your prayers and someone who is always there. You dont have to wait and hope for the better. Instant results. In the video we see two groups of people, brothel girls and cowboys. Both  lead their separate lives and they have their own way of looking at things. Cowboys can lead a more sophisticated lives by working under someone in a city or something but they instead hear what their personal god say. Brothel girls have their own personal god who doesnt look down on prostitution, its just a way of living. They have their own faith and rules. They dont care about what anyone else thinks about their way of living.

"Lift up a receiver, i will make you a believer." This tells us that people who are their own god and have tasted the joy in it, are enthusiastic about changing the way how others live. "I will deliver, you know I am a forgiver." Always forgive yourself no matter how wrong your deeds be. This, my good sir, is infinite and ultimate freedom. Wow how good these lyrics are.

"Reach out touch faith", this is you. You cant materialise abstraction but you can see yourself. Be there for yourself, be your personal jesus.

Harmony between these two groups tells us that in our society we can remain mutually happy just like these two group of people if we listen to ourselves, glorify originality and don't let ourselves be constrained by others' moral values or rules. Instead, adapt our principles based on the situation as needed

Like a stone:
The artist is searching for answers. It is still unclear to me what exactly he is asking for. Maybe he is done something really wrong and is ready to face the consequences instantly. He is unable to forgive himself. Once he gets to the place where he can finally meet him, he will prepare to present himself. Then there will be no coming back.

Maybe the artist is categorizing his entire life as worthy of heaven or hell. Before this life was granted to him, he had been through literal hell when he reached his judgement day. Maybe he is asking "Why am I inherently bad?" because by the tone of the music I feel it is something really wrong that he has done again which will make him visit hell once more. He is ready to face anything and doesnt wanna live until he gets his answers.

A child who has inherent abilities and talent from birth gets paralysed down by the dreams of others and the effect of capitalism cages him down. As we can see in the video the crown that the child is bestowed with, doesnt immediately effect the child. It shows itself gradually. The crown is melting the person bit by bit until he has a final breakdown. This breakdown puts him estranged. The bubbles coming out of his head are the dreams and ambitions which are his own. These are starting to occur when he is at his lowest caged down in the ditch. These dreams and ambitions are trying to put the child back up on the mainland but the obligations to others outweigh those. these bubbles start to get away from the child. the bubbles keep getting smaller and smaller depicting his hope of becoming better are becoming thinner until the body finally decays. the mainland monsters are the reason for his deterioration. by sucking up all of his dreams and ambitions, the monster of capitalism finally relaxes down and breathes out crushed dreams. The soul transforms into a wanderer who is decaying even while the body is gone. Its the ultimate extinction of the individual. The rabbit is the observer of the universe. As soon as he sees the crushed dreams and decaying body in the air, he runs up to the ditch to collect the crown. The crown is the symbol of individuality and originality. He takes it down to the very bottom of the planet depicting that this individuality is forever gone. "All you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be" tells us that you have the right to take the decision of doing whats right for you, what you choose is what you will get. Fulfill others' dreams because you love them and cry for yourself. The longer you keep doing this, you loose your originality and meet your death in no time. Because, my good sir, time flies.
